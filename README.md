# Libft
42 Project 1 Libft

This project involved crafting my own C library, 
featuring functions for memory manipulation, string operations, 
and an additional bonus of linked list functionalities.

Through this practical exercise, I gained proficiency in fundamental utility operations, 
covering tasks from basic character classification and file descriptor operations 
to more advanced capabilities like conversions, and memory handling.

The resulting library now serves as a versatile toolkit for my future projects in C programming.
